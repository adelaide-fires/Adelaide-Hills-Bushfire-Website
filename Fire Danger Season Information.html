            </ul>

                <li>Be prepared and remain vigilant</li>
                <li>Fires can pose a danger, so stay updated and make decisions on actions you may wish to take</li>

            <h3>Extreme:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Continuously monitor official channels and take preemptive actions</li>
                <li>Immediate action in the event of a fire is essential</li>
